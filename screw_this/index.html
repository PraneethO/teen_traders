          <h1>About Us</h1>
          Teen Traders is an organization dedicated to teaching teenagers and
          high-school students about stock market investing, personal finance,
          and financial literacy. Through competition-based learning, students
          are able to grasp fundamental investing concepts and learn how to grow
          their portfolios using a variety of strategies. Throughout the
          process, there will be videos and meetings to help students navigate
          the world of finance. Every resource is completely free to use for
          students and is designed to prepare them for financial success in
          their lives.
          <br />
          <br />
          Starting to invest at a young age is one of the most beneficial things
          you can do for your financial health. Using the power of compound
          interest coupled with safe investing strategies, you can grow your net
          worth at a stable and impressive rate. This concept is demonstrated on
          our YouTube channel, The Teenage Investor, through this short video.
          <br />
          As we looked around, we realized that there was a stark lack of
          financial knowledge and a large difference in knowledge between young,
          new investors and tried and tested traders. With numbers like this,
          most young adults are going into the financial world not knowing about
          Roth IRAs, 401(k)s, or basic investment strategy.<br />
          <div style="height: 2vh"></div>
          <br />
          By teaching personal finance and investment management, not only do we
          set people up with the skills necessary to get ahead, we let them test
          it in real-world scenarios.
